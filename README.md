# Interactive Dance Installation 

## Overview

The following image shows how the installation was implemented in the final performance. The projection as well as the motion tracking sensor were attatched to the ceiling. The image is from [Saar Magals](http://www.saarmagal.com) website. If wished, this is also a good source for more detailed information about the performance.
