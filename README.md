# Interactive Dance Installation 

The following image shows how the installation was implemented in the final performance at Rote Fabrik. The projection as well as the motion tracking sensor were attatched to the ceiling. While the dancers were moving trough the active space, they would create there personal space of light. A collapsing light trail. The image is from [Saar Magals](http://www.saarmagal.com) website. If wished, this is also a good source for more detailed information about the performance.

## Setup

Needed hardware and software
* Computer with processing installed and the code from the light_installation folder
* Kinect Sensor V2
* Strong Projector, best with a big viewport
* Long USB 3 cable and HDMI cable to connect all the tools.

The hardware setup needs some attention. The plan above shows how it should look like at the end. The Kinect sensor needs to be in the middle of everything, this is very important. Take care to place the Kinect Sensor horizontally. This ensures a good mapping in the end. The projecter needs to be placed next to the sensor. The distance should not be to big so that the image is not going to be distorted to much. It would be best, if the viewport of the projector and the Kinect would match perfectly.

This project was implemented by [Carlo Natter](https://github.com/CarlosGreatHouseOfFaultyGarbage) and [Aurelian Ammon](https://github.com/aurelianammon) as part of a students project at ZHdK. The module was lead by [Luke Franzke](https://www.lukefranzke.com/) who was a big support while developing the concept and the code.
